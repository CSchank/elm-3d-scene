## `elm-3d-scene` examples

This directory contains several examples of using `elm-3d-scene` to create
different kinds of 3D graphics. To get started, check out the `elm-3d-scene`
repository and start up `elm reactor` in this directory, then start playing
around with the different examples (or create your own!). If you have questions,
please reach out in the **#webgl** channel or to **@ianmackenzie** on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com).

### Beginner

These examples (in rough order of complexity) introduce various core rendering
techqniues and concepts.

- `HelloWorld.elm`
- `Triangles.elm`
- `Points.elm`
- `PhysicallyBasedRendering.elm`
- `Rotation.elm`
- `CustomMesh.elm`
- `LightingAndShadows.elm`

### Intermediate

These examples incorporate The Elm Architecture (TEA) in order to implement
animation, interactivity, and texturing (which requires an HTTP request, and
therefore some state handling).

- `Texture.elm`
- `Animation.elm`
- `DynamicBackground.elm`
- `OrbitingCamera.elm`

### Advanced

Finally, these examples generally combine two or more techniques/concepts to
create more complex and interesting scenes. 

- `TexturedSphere.elm`
- `MultipleShadows.elm`
- `ExposureAndToneMapping.elm`
